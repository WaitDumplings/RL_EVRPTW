# Usage Guide

## Train
- You can modify configurations in `configurations.py`.  
- For model settings, refer to the `configurations.Config()` class.

## Test and Plot
- Check the `test.py` script for testing and visualization.  
- Key parameters to adjust:
  - **Checkpoint Path**: Set the path to your trained model checkpoint (`ckpt`).
  - **Graph Size**: Define the size of the graph for the test dataset.  

- After running the script, the output images will be automatically saved in the `./images` directory.
